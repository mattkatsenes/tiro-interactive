    <comment>This is a user editable textbox designed to store student notes to an xml file while reading this page. (Currently the notes are saved whenever the this box loses focus)

Note that the unitalicized words can be clicked on to display an ajax style definition.

Currently this page is experimental, and the source is fairly unreadable.  But it makes use of a controller/children model to keep track of edits to the text boxes on the right (loaded by click the [+]).  The amount of time spent editing each box is kept in an ajax array for later storage.
