#summary The output methods used to convert a TEI-(tiro)-XML doc to an output format.

= Introduction =

As a result of the input side of the tiro system, a well formed TEI-(tiro)-XML document is created.  This document lacks presentation information, requiring a system to convert this xml to a useful display format such as html.

To this end, the tiro-interactive project uses [http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/ Apache Cocoon 2.1] as an xml/xslt/etc handler.  Using a series of style-sheets, a given xml document is transformed into a linked series of well formed xhtml pages dynamically for access.

Through the magic of [http://fop.apache.org/ FOP], these xhtml pages are further converted into PDF files or RTF files for download.
